# Fog template for C++

This is a template repository for creating games with
[Fog](https://github.com/FredTheDino/Fog) and C++.

# Compatability
The following combinations have been tested at least once and should "just work":tm:.

| OS      | Compiler                      | Target      |
| ------- | ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| Linux   | gcc (9.3.0)                   | Linux       |
| Linux   | x86\_64-w64-mingw32-gcc       | Windows [1] |
| macOS   | built-in (clang-1001.0.46.4)  | macOS       |

\[1]: MinGW is not required to run a Windows-executable compiled on Linux.

In the following days I'll be testing the following and will (hopefully) be able
to update the table above.

| OS      | Compiler                     | Target      |
| ------- | ---------------------------- | ----------- |
| Windows | gcc (mingw)                  | Windows     |

# Prerequisites

- Python 3 (3.3 and lower not supported)

## Linux and Mac

- A compiler for C++
- SDL2, preferably from your package manager. I personally get SDL2 from
  Homebrew (`brew install sdl2`) on macOS and [extra] on Arch (`pacman -S
  sdl2`).

## Windows (TBD)

- MinGW
- [SDL2 runtime binaries](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)

## Targeting Windows from Linux (TBD)

- MinGW cross compiler, e.g.
  https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mingw-w64-gcc/
- SDL2 for your cross compiler, e.g.
  https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mingw-w64-sdl2/

# Usage

1. Press the button labelled "Use this template" above (to the left of "Clone or
   download") to create your own repository with the same directories and files
   as this repository.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine and `cd` into it.
3. Add fog as a submodule.
```shell
$ git submodule add https://github.com/FredTheDino/Fog.git fog
```
4. Compile and run.
```shell
$ make run
```

The repo contains a very basic example which shows how to create some keybinds,
render a point on the screen and start a main-loop.

You don't *have* to add fog as a submodule. However, if you need to fix the
engine during development (or have someone else implement a fix) it's easier to
track and share these changes. Unfortunately Github doesn't add submodules when
creating a copy of a template repository.

## Examples

The only real difference between bindings for C and C++ (that comes to bind) is
the operator overloading for vectors. This means that mostly everything from the
[examples in the C-repo](https://github.com/sornas/fog-template-c#examples)
applies here as well, so go take a look at them if you feel like it.

## Stuff to keep in mind

A few compromises had do be done when implementing the C-bindings.

The built-in engine documentation (`fog/tools/doc.html`) is still available
(also [hosted externally](https://fog.xn--srns-noa9h.se)).

Particle systems, which used to be classes, now need to be passed
as the first parameter to their methods. `void ParticleSystem::spawn(u32
num_particles=1)` becomes `void fog_renderer_particle_spawn(ParticleSystem
*system, u32 num_particles)` and so on.

Another thing to keep in mind is that C doesn't support default parameters so
you need to specify all parameters when calling functions.

If you are unsure about the parameters/usage/name of a function, a quick look in
`inc/fog.h` might refresh your memory.

# Distributing your game

[SDL2 prefers to be linked dynamically](https://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/file/default/docs/README-dynapi.md)
so if you want to distribute your game you need to make sure that the recipient
has access to it. The consensus seems to be that builds targeting Linux
shouldn't need to package SDL2 since it is almost always available in the
package manager, while builds targeting Windows should distribute
SDL2 alongside the executable. For macOS I'd recommend downloading SDL2
separately (either with Homebrew or from https://www.libsdl.org/).

On Windows you also need to distribute pthreads if you don't want to require
MinGW. It can be downloaded from
https://packages.msys2.org/package/mingw-w64-x86_64-libwinpthread. The SDL2
runtime binaries can be downloaded from https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php.
These should go in the same folder as your executable.

If you're compiling on Linux you can use the following commands to create a
distributable .zip-file.

```shell
$ zip game.zip data.fog <executable>  # targeting linux
$ zip -j game.zip data.fog <executable.exe> fog/lib/windows/SDL2.dll fog/lib/windows/winpthreads/libwinpthread-1.dll  # targeting windows
```
The `j`-flag discards the directory structure since the `dll`-files need to be
in the same directory as the executable.


## Licensing of code

A quick word about licensing in case you're distributing your game publicly.

```
Your game
|-- Fog (MIT)
    |-- getline implementation from SO (public domain)
    |-- files generated by glad (probably public domain [2])
    |-- stb_image (public domain)
    |-- SDL2 headers (zlib)
|-- SDL2 (zlib)
|-- (winpthreads) (MIT)
```
